# KLIFSAI
Kinase bioactivity prediction models to help discover kinase inhibitor

This repository will be a minimal version of KLIFSAI. KLIFSAI will provide a Random Forest Classifier to help in the process of kinase discovery. 

The repo files will contain a kinase name and uniprot_id that data collect depend on it for example ( Src Kinase | P12931).

`This project doesn't have any sponsor yet, you can become a sponser.`

This project will be a part of large project that will provide a deep and valid models to help disover a selective inhibitor for kinases.

The aim of the project is to help any Cancer Institute or Research institute to develop selective cancer drug for FREE or cheap price.

Ù‘`Data will be provided with the paper of every kinase, but the RF model will be provided as soon as it has been completed`
